				<h1><em>You</em> desire to Buy !</h1>

					<em>Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?<br> Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change... That. Is. Crazy.<br> The first time somebody told me that, I dunno, I thought they were bullshitting me, so, boom, I shot him. The thing is... he was right. And then I started seeing, everywhere I looked, everywhere I looked all these fucking pricks, everywhere I looked, doing the exact same fucking thing... over and over and over and over again thinking: "This time is gonna be different. No, no, no please... This time is gonna be different."<br> Okay, Do you have a fucking problem in your head, do you think I am bullshitting you, do you think I am lying? Fuck you! Okay? Fuck you!... It's okay, man. I'm gonna chill, hermano. I'm gonna chill... and it's not like I am fucking crazy. It's okay... It's like water under the bridge. Did I ever tell you the definition... of insanity?"<br></em>

					<em>The things you own end up owning you.<br>
					Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.<br>You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.<br>f you don't know what you want," the doorman said, "you end up with a lot you don't.</em>
